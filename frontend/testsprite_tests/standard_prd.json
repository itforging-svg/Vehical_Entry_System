  "product_overview": "The Vehicle Entry System is a digital solution designed to manage and automate vehicle entries and exits at controlled premises such as corporate offices, residential complexes, or parking lots. It replaces manual logbooks, enhances security via role-based access, and provides real-time vehicle occupancy data along with historical reporting.",
  "core_goals": [
    "Digitize and automate vehicle entry and exit logging to improve security and efficiency.",
    "Enable role-based access control distinguishing between Security Guards and Administrators.",
    "Capture detailed driver and vehicle information, including photo capture and historical lookup.",
    "Provide real-time dashboard views and historical reports with export capabilities.",
    "Ensure system performance, reliability, scalability, and mobile responsiveness."
  ],
  "key_features": [
    "Secure login system with role distinction (Admin and Guard).",
    "Vehicle entry registration capturing vehicle details, driver info, purpose, and timestamp.",
    "Vehicle exit processing with search by license plate or token ID and automatic exit time logging.",
    "Admin dashboard for log monitoring, record approval/rejection, editing, and status updates.",
    "Print-friendly gate pass generation for verified vehicle entries.",
    "Historical vehicle entry and exit report generation with date filtering and export (CSV/Excel).",
    "Real-time dashboard showing current parked vehicles count.",
    "Mobile-responsive UI optimized for handheld devices used by security guards."
  ],
  "user_flow_summary": [
    "User logs in via secure authentication identifying their role (Admin or Guard).",
    "From the dashboard, the security guard initiates a new vehicle entry by filling a form capturing license plate, vehicle type, driver name, contact, purpose, and photo.",
    "Upon submission, the system timestamps the entry and generates a unique token ID, updating the dashboard vehicle count.",
    "For vehicle exit, the guard searches by license plate or token ID, confirms exit, which timestamps the time out and marks the vehicle as exited.",
    "Admins access the dashboard to monitor logs, approve or reject entries, edit records, and export reports.",
    "Users can print a gate pass from the entry records via a dedicated print-optimized page."
  ],
  "validation_criteria": [
    "System must successfully authenticate users and enforce role-based access.",
    "Vehicle entry submissions must capture all required fields and generate unique pass IDs with accurate timestamps.",
    "Vehicle exit searches and update must reliably mark vehicles as exited with correct time calculations.",
    "Dashboard loads within 2 seconds and reflects real-time vehicle counts accurately.",
    "Admin can filter historical records by date and export data in CSV or Excel formats.",
    "UI must be fully responsive and usable on mobile and tablet devices.",
    "No data loss or concurrency issues occur during heavy logging operations up to 100,000 records.",
    "Print gate passes should be formatted correctly and generated without errors."
